			<section id="three"> <h1>Our Story</h1>
				<p>Fifty States Brewing Company is the Brainchild of Co-Founder and CEO (Chief Executive Officer) Stephen Gasparini and was made possible through the collaberation of Stephens ideas and business plan, and the elquisate tastebuds of Jim Coleman, Co-Founder and CBO (Cheif Brewing Officer).  </p>
				<p> Once Jim and Stephen got their tastes right and had extensive years of experience catering to the wants of the average American beer consumers, they expanded their brewing from their two person apartment on Syracuse University Hill to a brand new facility on the West side of Syracuse,NY funded by Gary Gasparini, Lead Investor and father of Stephen Gasparini.</p>
				<p>While Stephen managed to continue and build on what they already had brewing, Jim set off to travel the country and find unique tastes from each state and territory to compliment their own brew.</p>
				<p> Once Expanded to their second location in Waterbury, CT The two needed to expand their Executive Board bring in Stephen's Fraternity Brother in Delta Chi, Peter Morelli to become the COO (Chief Operations Officer) and Stephen's sister Karin Gasparini as CFO (Chief Financial Officer).</p>
				<p> Opening under their Corporate name in January 2014, FIfty States Brewing is a young company still fighting its way up the food chain, and rather quickly.  Some credit the rapid sucess to the Founders education at Syracuse University, but when asked Jim and Steve explained they do what they do so well because they both just love a good beer.</p>
